Instruction Manual for the Algorithms listed in this repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below are the main algorithms 

1. SINDy autoencoder: (General and one equation versions) for the discovery of dynamical systems along with training data generation.
2. Linear modes autoencoder: For the purpose of discovering the modeshapes and modal responses of a vibration system.
3. Nonlinear modes autoencoder: Under Developement.
4. Disontinous PINN: To solve continous and discontinous bar PDE problems.
5. Weak form PINN: To solve continous bar problem (NOT WORKING)
6. 1D FEM solver for the generation of training data for various applications.

A Note:

Inside many algorithms, training data must first be generated for the input of the neural networks. In such cases, please run the associated training data generation file whose steps are detailed inside the folder of each algorithm before running the solver.
