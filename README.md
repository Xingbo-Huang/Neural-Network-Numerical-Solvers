Below are the main algorithms 

1. SINDy autoencoder: (General and one equation versions) for the discovery of dynamical systems along with training data generation.
2. Linear modes autoencoder: For the purpose of discoveing the modeshapes and modal responses of a vibration system.
3. Disontinous PINN: To solve continous and discontinous bar PDE problems.
4. Weak form PINN: To solve continous bar problem (NOT WORKING)
5. 1D FEM solver for the generation of training data for various applications.
